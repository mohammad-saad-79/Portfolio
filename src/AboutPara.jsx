                I'm a 3rd-year B.Tech Computer Science student at Maulana Azad National Urdu University, 
                passionate about web development. I'm now working on my portfolio using React and plan to 
                move into backend development with Node.js and MongoDB to become a full-stack developer. 
                I’ve also explored programming in Java, Python, C, and C++, which has helped me understand 
                the logic and structure behind software development.

                Coding is not just a skill for me — it's something I truly enjoy. 
                I’m committed to improving every day and growing as a developer.
                I’m a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
                I love creating responsive, user-friendly websites and constantly strive to improve my skills.
                Currently, I’m focused on becoming a full stack developer and building real-world projects.
                I use Git and GitHub to manage my code and collaborate effectively.
                For deployment, I work with platforms like Netlify and Vercel to bring my projects online.
                Every line of code I write brings me closer to my goal of becoming a professional developer.
